    <p>
    You  can  configure Git LFS to only fetch objects to satisfy references
    in certain paths of the repo, and/or to exclude certain  paths  of  the
    repo, to reduce the time you spend downloading things you do not use.
    </p>

    <p>
    Set include pattern and exclude pattern to comma-separated lists of paths
    to include/exclude in the fetch (pattern  matching as  per  golangÂ´s  filepath.Match()).
    Only  paths which are matched by include pattern and not matched by exclude
    pattern will have objects fetched for them.
    </p>
